1. In API, ensure that during the creation of the array, only pictures are added
2. Create new function that will retrieve a thumbnail for each folder
   - Should save new thumbnail if doesn't exist yet
3. Add error handling. Right now everything is a bit happy path coding
4. Add testing (preferably in place)
5. Make thumbnail into link, that opens new component that:
   - Renders the full size pictures
   - Renders the description
6. Add contact page/form
7. Look into php security
